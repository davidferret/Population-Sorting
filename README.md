# Population Sorting Project

This C project reads country population data, sorts it based on your preferences, and saves the results to a file. You can sort the countries in three different ways: alphabetically by name, by population in ascending order, or by population in descending order. The interactive prompt makes it simple to select your preferred sorting method. Once the data is sorted, it is displayed in a formatted table, and if needed, it can be saved to a text file for later reference. I created this project to practice working with data structures and sorting algorithms while handling real-world information. Sorting and organizing population data is useful in many applications, from demographic studies to economic analysis. This project gave me the opportunity to optimize sorting functions and refine file-handling techniques, making it an engaging and rewarding challenge.

## Example Output
```
Choose sorting method:
1 - Sort by Country (Alphabetically)
2 - Sort by Population (Ascending)
3 - Sort by Population (Descending)
Enter choice: 2

Country         Population (Millions)
Canada          37.74
Argentina       45.38
Brazil         212.56
USA            331.00

Data saved to 'sorted_population.txt'.
